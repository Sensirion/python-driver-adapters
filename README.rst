Driver adapters
====================

This package contains the base classes used by driver generator.
It handles low-level things like type conversions, packing of commands,
checksum calculation, error handling etc.


Note
----

Normally you shouldn't use this driver directly - instead you should use the
device-specific driver for your actual device as it provides easy-to-use
commands.


Installation and Usage
